Working Connect 4 game with Singleplayer and Multiplayer modes

Game features a Welcome Screen where the User is Prompted to enter their desired Username and choose between playing against AI/Computer or online versus real players.
Multiplayer features 3 lobbies which accomodate 2 players each.
Server was deployed on Railway, enabling users to play from any location in real time. (Server repo is on my profile as 'connect-4-server')
Each multiplayer lobby includes a live chat box where opponents can chat with each other in real time.
